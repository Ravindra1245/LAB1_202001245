           Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:
           
           
The institute has been recently set up to provide state-of-the-art research facilities in the
field of Software Engineering. Apart from research scholars (students) and professors, it also
includes quite a large number of employees who work on different projects undertaken by
the institution.
As the size and capacity of the institute is increasing with the time, it has been proposed to
develop a Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the
institute. LIS will enable the members to borrow a book (or return it) with ease while sitting
at his desk/chamber. The system also enables a member to extend the date of his borrowing
if no other booking for that particular book has been made. For the library staff, this system
aids them to easily handle day-to-day book transactions. The librarian, who has
administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into
the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf. Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books
online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.
The final deliverable would be a web application (using the recent HTML 5), which should
run only within the institute LAN. Although this reduces security risk of the software to a
large extent, care should be taken no confidential information (eg., passwords) is stored in
plain text.  



                *Functional requirement*

      1.users can request,reserve, or renew a book
      2.the system should notify the user and librarian about the overdue books.
      3.the system calculates the fine for overdue books on their return.
      4.users should search for books based on title,date,author,publication etc. and find their location in  the library
      5.studdent and employee login 
      - borrowing a book and returning a book
      -extend return date if no other booking request are made for that particular book.
      -borrowing or returning a book require user to login
      6.librarian login
      -create a new record to indicate the borrow of a book
      -delete the record of the book that is borrowed.
      7.the user privacy should be maintained in the sense of which book (s) he is borrowing



                 *non-functional requirement

    ans:1.the system should not have any bugs inside to use it must be working properly,correctly and efficiency.
        2.adding new features to the  software and updating the features muswt have to be simple systems software should have portability
        3.software documentation should be well defined and organized.
        4.the database of the system must be correct,consistent and realible.
        5.realiability- the database must be kept up to date so that it does't display a book as available if it isn't actuallyn available or show a book as marked as           borowwed by a user when that user has already the book.
        6.usability-the website shgould be easily accesible through any basic web browser that supports html and should be able to run on moble phone.
        7.accuracy-the information that is record about the books and the fines that are calculayed must be accurate,realible .
        
        

       Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
  Approximately 5% of the world population (or a staggering 466 million people) suffers from
  disabling hearing loss. We set out to create an impactful solution for this community that
  addresses some of their everyday needs. Our mobile application uses artificial intelligence to
  recognize key sound events of interest to this community, such as car horns and babies,
  where immediate alerts and continual logging are critical for the user. This app is optimized
  for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for use.


     ans:1.scope and features of the system.
         -the app would be targetting such people as they are the ones for whom the app is being desinged for.
         -this system can widely used by the people who are suffering from the disabling hearing loss disease.
         -at doorstep then njotification of bell ringing would go to user we can also aa an feature emergency alarms
         -low latency to enable real-time use
         -the app should alert the users when it recognizes the sounds of critical situation.

         2.non functional aspects
         -the app should alert the user through some vibration.
         -user should be able to send their current position to friends and relatives in case of an emergency via the app;.
         -the latency of the app should be at most 2 secon ds.
